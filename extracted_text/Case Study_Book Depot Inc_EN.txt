Areas of application for ProGlove at 
Book Depot Inc.
With the introduction of ProGlove, Book Depot experienced a remarkable 
reduction in takt time. In the receiving area, where thousands of books are 
processed daily, the ProGlove MARK 3 enabled the team to scan items from 
inside the forklift, eliminating the need for separate handheld scanners. 
This simplified their daily routine and reduced takt time by up to 8 seconds 
per carton, allowing for faster processing and improved productivity. 
Prioritizing employee safety, Book Depot adopted MARK 3 in their bulk 
inventory management system. This implementation proved to be a game-
changer for workers who operated at heights of up to 7.5 meters. The ability 
to scan quickly and reliably from a distance, while freeing both hands, 
empowered operators to remain within the machine's boundaries and 
maintain focus. As a result, their safety while working at elevated heights 
was ensured.Use Case 1:

The shelf picking process underwent a major transformation with the 
integration of ProGlove's LEO scanner. Designed specifically for nearfield 
scanning tasks, it replaced the outdated wedge scanners previously used. 
The introduction of tablets instead of netbooks increased the mobility and 
flexibility of the staff, while also streamlining the process and reducing the 
number of steps required. As a result, Book Depot achieved an impressive 
4-second reduction in takt time per scan, significantly improving overall 
efficiency. 
In the auto sortation area, the ProGlove LEO scanners proved to be 
invaluable. These advanced devices enabled team members to work hands-
free, scanning barcodes at the destination and seamlessly pairing them 
with the corresponding cartons. As a result, takt time was reduced by four 
seconds per assigned tote, streamlining the sorting process and ensuring 
efficient order fulfillment. Additionally, MARK Display helped them quickly 
verify customer ID and destination and provided quick troubleshooting 
capabilities for customer orders that required extra attention, further 
enhancing accuracy and customer satisfaction. Use Case 2:
